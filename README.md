# Analysis-of-Stress-in-the-Paraspinal-Musculature-of-Heels
This project analyzes the load/stress on the spinal muscles due to usage of heels. It has been known that wearing heels leads to slight to severe back pain and hyper-lordosis. The current study aims to establish the effects of wearing heels on the spinal musculature. This is done by recording electromyography of the paraspinal muscles, namely, the erector spinae and multifidus, of the local population of Chennai wearing heels. The EMG recording was preprocessed to remove the noise and artifacts, and its time domain and frequency domain features are extracted. The main features utilized are root mean squared value and power spectral density. These parameters were estimated for each subject when they are barefoot, and when they wear 7 cm heels. This work gives an understanding of load exerted on the spinal muscles and how it affects the spine curvature while walking with and without heels. The study also aims to compare the sacropelvic parameters due to usage of heels by taking X-ray images with and without heels and the EMG data.

The Dataset for the study is obtained from the EMG of ten healthy, young women who have had no spinal surgeries in the last six months, and have not experienced any musculoskeletal injuries will be examined under two conditions while walking - 1) barefoot 2) wearing 7 cm heels. 

The code is done using MATLAB.
